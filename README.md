This is one of my initial works to build a navigation system using separate GSM and GNSS modules along with AVR micro-controller.

AVR micro-controller was used to communicate between GSM and GNSS modules.
Parsing of data was done in the micro-controller.
The logs were put in the memory card which was interfaced with AVR.
Acclerometer were used to detect the motion of the vehicles.

The available memory of micro-controller was optimally used to implement the complete functionality.
The brain of the system was micro-controller and limited memory gave addtional constraints to implement the functionality.
